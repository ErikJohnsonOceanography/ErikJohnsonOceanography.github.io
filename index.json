Occasional influxes of this silicate-rich neritic water past the shelf break and beyond the Subtropical Front have been observed, potentially supporting elevated chlorophyll-a concentrations in SubAntarctic waters. Nearshore salinity variability has been connected to flow rates of the Clutha River, Aotearoa’s largest river by discharge, however, other physical mechanisms influencing the structure of freshwater along this coast have not been explicitly explored. A numerical model of Aotearoa’s southeast continental shelf forced with realistic discharge from the Clutha River is used to assess the drivers of river plume variability and identify conditions associated with the transport of neritic water beyond the shelf break. Event scale, lagged correlation, EOF, and composite analysis of a model passive dye tracer revealed three generalised plume structures that are dependent on river discharge, along-front wind stress, and shelf current velocities. Downfront wind stress suppresses bulge formation at the river mouth and constrains the river plume against the coast, whereas upfront wind stress causes the river plume to move offshore over the shelf and spread across the upper water column. Rarely, upfront wind stress generates a nearshore current reversal over the shelf, causing the plume to deflect straight off-shelf and across the shelf edge before meeting the frontal current and advecting to the northeast. Future observational work is required to validate the mechanisms described and address the biological implications of these findings.\nSchematic diagram of three generalised plume structures.

Marked by strong hydrographic gradients and energetic circulation, shelf break regions are often associated with elevated primary productivity, carbon sequestration, and thermohaline exchange. Using a synthesis of remotely-sensed, in situ, and modelled data, this work investigates subseasonal (\u0026lt; 60 day) biophysical variability (eg. chlorophyll-a, stratification, freshwater influence) along a shelf break front situated in southeast Aotearoa/New Zealand. This is a culturally and ecologically significant region associated with increased chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) biomass, high trophic level species, and fisheries activity. Despite the importance of this region, previous work has been mostly limited to infrequent boat-based surveys, limiting the understanding of this region on time scales of less than a month.\nUsing 22 years of remotely-sensed Chl-a data, the processes driving episodic summer Chl-a bloom events over the shelf break are investigated. Analysis of local wind stress showed a lagged relationship between shelf break Chl-a and along-front wind stress, with Chl-a enhancements as large as the seasonal cycle occurring approximately 5 days after periods of upfront wind stress. Historic in situ water samples support the remotely sensed Chl-a observations, and also indicate nutrient-replete conditions at the shelf break throughout summer, suggesting that another limiting factor controls these episodic blooms. A mooring deployment over an austral summer season captures mixed layers deepening to the seabed following downfront wind stress, and rapidly restratifying following upfront winds. From this, potential physical mechanisms controlling light availability are discussed.\nTo better understand the structure and time scales of stratification variability over the shelf, a cross-shelf mooring array was deployed over an austral summer. Multiple instances of mixed layer deepening/shoaling were observed through the deployment, associated with downfront/upfront wind stress. These results challenge previous characterisations of the Otago shelf as seasonally stratified in summer, likely stemming from fair-weather bias in boat-based surveys that reduces the likelihood of observing deep mixed layers following strong downfront wind stress. A stratification budget is calculated to investigate the contributions of different physical mechanisms to observed stratification variability. This budget suggests that periods of destratification, associated with downfront winds, are likely driven by onshore Ekman transport, with rapid restratification over the mid to outer shelf being associated with upfront winds and formation of submesoscale instabilities in the mixed layer.\nOutput from a realistic numerical model is used to study the evolution of a nationally-significant river plume and the physical mechanisms controlling its evolution and offshore extent. The spatial pattern of the river plume is shown to be related to the rate of freshwater discharge, along-front wind stress, and shelf current. During periods of downfront wind stress the freshwater plume is constrained to the coast, during upfront wind stress the plume spreads over the shelf as a thin surface layer. Occasionally, upfront wind stress causes a reversal of currents over the shelf and the plume detaches from the coast and flows straight offshore, passing the shelf break and being entrained in the shelf break current.

Summer wind stress over the OSB was shelf-aligned, oscillating between upfront and downfront. Surface Chl-a concentrations along the OSB were shown to increase episodically (≤10 days duration) following upfront wind stress. This response occurred over most of the 350 km long shelf break, and was most intense north of the Otago Peninsula. Peak Chl-a enhancement at the shelf break occurred following periods of upfront winds, exhibiting a lagged response of approximately 5 days. Moored thermistor data indicated that upfront wind events were followed by increased thermal stratification over the mid-shelf, whereas downfront wind events were followed by a well-mixed water column. In situ temperature, salinity, and nutrient measurements suggested an offshore movement of the surface expression of the front following upfront winds, and a reduction in nitrate over the shelf break. From these observations a model of Ekman restratification driven by upfront winds is proposed for this system, wherein off-shelf Ekman transport converts strong horizontal isopycnal gradients at the shelf break front into vertical stratification. This stratification holds phytoplankton in the upper water column, allowing increased access to light, which is marked by the increased drawdown of nitrate at the shelf break. Downfront winds break down this stratification, move the shelf break front onshore, and mix phytoplankton through the water column, reducing the surface expression of chlorophyll.\nProposed shelf break bloom mechanism at the Otago Shelf Break during downfront winds (a), and upfront winds (b).
